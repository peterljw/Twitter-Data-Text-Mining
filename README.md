# Twitter-Data-Text-Mining

This project consists of an R Shiny web app that retrieves a number of tweets on a particular topic based on the user's inputs. The web app then processes the text data with NLP techniques and outpus a sentimen analysis indicator that aims to capture the emotions displayed in the text content as well as a word cloud which highlights frequent words used in the retrieved tweets.
